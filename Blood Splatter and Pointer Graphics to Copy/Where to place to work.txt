Copy and paste this folder into the tokens\host folder. That will display bloodsplatters on npc/pc death and the display of the Shift+Left-Click map focus graphics.

Your path should look something like this if you installed your data folder with the default name:
[Some drive, C: for example]\[any sub directory path if any]\Fantasy Grounds Data\tokens\host\items

You can also find this path by opening up your game. Clicking on Tokens -> GM.
